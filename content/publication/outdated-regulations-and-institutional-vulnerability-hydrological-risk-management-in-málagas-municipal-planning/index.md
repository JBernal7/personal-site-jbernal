abstract: Málaga, a Mediterranean region, is increasingly prone to water-related
  risks, a situation compounded by the impacts of climate change. Urban
  development practices over the past decades have significantly exacerbated
  these risks. Our study offers a novel, scientifically derived methodology to
  evaluate municipal capabilities in managing hydrological risks through urban
  planning instruments. Leveraging a checklist applied through multicriteria
  analysis, we scrutinized the integration of theoretical and regulatory
  frameworks relating to hydrological risks in numerous municipalities. Our
  findings highlight a glaring deficiency in local Disaster Risk Reduction
  strategies in alignment with the Sendai Framework. Additionally, there's
  minimal incorporation of natural risk analysis and mapping into planning
  instruments. Our results spotlight Málaga's high institutional vulnerability
  due to its limited capacity in hydrological risk management, underlining the
  pressing necessity for land use policies informed by risk assessments and
  prioritizing citizen safety. This study significantly contributes to future
  urban planning initiatives, offering a roadmap toward more resilient
  communities amid escalating hydrological risks.
