	abstract = {M´alaga, a Mediterranean region, is increasingly prone to water-related risks, a situation com­ pounded by the impacts of climate change. Urban development practices over the past decades have significantly exacerbated these risks. Our study offers a novel, scientifically derived meth­ odology to evaluate municipal capabilities in managing hydrological risks through urban plan­ ning instruments. Leveraging a checklist applied through multicriteria analysis, we scrutinized the integration of theoretical and regulatory frameworks relating to hydrological risks in numerous municipalities. Our findings highlight a glaring deficiency in local Disaster Risk Reduction strategies in alignment with the Sendai Framework. Additionally, there’s minimal incorporation of natural risk analysis and mapping into planning instruments. Our results spot­ light M´alaga’s high institutional vulnerability due to its limited capacity in hydrological risk management, underlining the pressing necessity for land use policies informed by risk assess­ ments and prioritizing citizen safety. This study significantly contributes to future urban planning initiatives, offering a roadmap toward more resilient communities amid escalating hydrological risks.},
