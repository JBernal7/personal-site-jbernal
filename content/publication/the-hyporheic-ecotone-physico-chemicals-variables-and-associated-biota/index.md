abstract: "In most river systems, surface water is connected to the groundwater
  stream through the riverbed sediments. This saturated transition zone, in
  which there is a bidirectional exchange of matter and energy, is called the
  hyporheic zone or hyporheic ecotone. The hyporheic ecotone is strongly
  influenced by spatio-temporal variations. We examine the hydrological and
  geomorphological factors that affect the hyporheic exchange flows, from the
  catchment scale to the river reach scale. The textural characteristics of the
  sediment, as well as the magnitude and direction of these changes, especially
  exhibited in the upwelling and downwelling zones, are key in the distribution
  of the hiporheic fauna. This fauna has been shown to play a crucial role in
  maintaining the necessary ecosystem functions to guarantee water quality and
  protect water against pollution and degradation caused directly and indirectly
  by anthropic effects. The study of these aspects are directly linked to the
  objectives of the Water Framework Directive, which is why the specific
  inclusion of hyporheic ecotones in the legislative field has been proposed. "
