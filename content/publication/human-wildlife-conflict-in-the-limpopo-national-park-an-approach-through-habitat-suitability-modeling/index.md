abstract: Among the large herbivores that inhabit the Mozambican Limpopo
  National Park are the elephant (L. africana), the buffalo (S. caffer), and the
  hippo (H. amphibius). Although since the moment of declaration of the
  territory as a National Park in 2001 the existing population within the park
  and adjoining areas have been relocating outside of it, the negative human
  interaction with the species continue to occur, a conflict exacerbated by
  drought and increasing pressure on freshwater resources. In this work, we
  approach this conflict through ensemble modeling of species and interactions,
  exploring the statistics to eventually provide heat maps of potential conflict
  areas in and around the park. The ensemble statistics showed in general good
  results in TSS (0.72-0.78), ROC (0.91-0.95), and Kappa (0.4-0.65) values. RF,
  Maxent, and GAM show better performance, with the variables of most importance
  in the models being altitude and mean temperature of the warmest month for L.
  africana; altitude and annual precipitation for S. caffer; and the dry season
  NDWI and annual precipitation for H. amphibius. Potential conflict points are
  found around the park, mainly distributed in the western half of it, if we
  consider the probability gradient of occurrence of the species. Our results
  illustrate the potential application of habitat distribution models in the
  study of human-wildlife conflicts.
