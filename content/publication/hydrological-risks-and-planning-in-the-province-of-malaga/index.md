abstract: "The province of Málaga is located in one of the Mediterranean regions
  most threatened by risks associated with water and the effects of climate
  change. This is recognized by European, state, and regional legislation and
  above all, this is clearly demonstrated by the increasingly frequent and
  intense torrential episodes, floods and droughts that directly affect the
  ecological, social, and economic environment of Málaga. Once the interference
  of urban development has been demonstrated during the last decades, the
  application of a checklist submitted to multicriteria analysis is proposed to
  evaluate the municipal capacities to face hydrological risks through their
  planning instruments. The results show the low integration of the existing
  theoretical and regulatory frameworks on hydrological risks, placing Málaga as
  a province with high institutional vulnerability to these risks. "
