From its inception, the Estación Biológica de Doñana (EBD-CSIC) has been intimately connected with Doñana, the estuary of the Guadalquivir River. The richness of its aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems - beaches, dunes, marshes, scrublands, pine forests, waterways, and lagoons - bestow upon it a unique character.

The EBD-CSIC is responsible for the administration and management of the Reserves of this protected space. Moreover, under Law 91/1978 of Doñana and Royal Decree 97/2005, the director of the EBD is responsible for coordinating all research projects in the Doñana Natural Area (106,047 ha) and for implementing the Monitoring Program.

In 2006, the RBD was recognized as a Scientific and Technological Infrastructure (ICTS-RBD) by the Interministerial Commission of Science and Technology (CICYT) of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science. This recognition has fostered continuous interaction among national and international researchers through short-term scientific stays funded by the Ministry.

This responsibility is supported by a team of about 30 technicians and managers, half of whom are dedicated to monitoring, and the other half to maintaining the field stations. In addition to the field stations in Doñana (Huelva and Sevilla), another is managed in Sierras de Cazorla, Segura, and Las Villas (Jaén). Both facilities facilitate the collection of ecological data for long-term studies.

The ICTS-RBD aims to provide access and support to the Spanish and international scientific community conducting research projects in the Doñana Protected Areas. It develops and implements state-of-the-art sensor systems interconnected by communication infrastructures, ensuring automated control of wildlife and Doñana's ecosystems and advancing scientific research based on this monitoring.

The ICTS-RBD provides accommodation, laboratories, equipment, and office space for researchers working in Doñana, along with scientific, technical, and logistical support. It has several facilities and programs that monitor the state and trends of biodiversity in the Doñana Protected Areas and, more broadly, in the western Mediterranean region.

A significant component of ICTS-RBD is its data infrastructure, which provides free online access to all information collected by the biodiversity monitoring facilities and programs for the international scientific community. To facilitate the search and use of this information, it also provides ICT services such as OLAP Cubes and virtual labs (elabs).

The [Global Change Observatory](http://observatorio.ebd.csic.es/) is ICTS-RBD's window to the general public, offering an easily accessible platform for the scientific activities developed in Doñana, as well as essential indicators of the state and trends of its wildlife and ecosystems, with opportunities for citizen participation.

Automated Data Infrastructure at the ICTS-EBD includes:

* Field Stations
* Phenocams
* Cameras
* Dashboards
