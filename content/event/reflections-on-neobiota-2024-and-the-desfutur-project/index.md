title: Reflections on Neobiota 2024 and the DesFutur Project
abstract: In September 2024, I presented findings from my PhD research at
  Neobiota, the 13th International Conference on Biological Invasions, held in
  Lisbon. My presentation focused on integrating local insights through
  interviews and a participatory workshop for the management of invasive species
  in Southeastern Iberian arid ecosystems. This work, conducted within the
  DesFutur project, highlighted the importance of incorporating stakeholder
  perspectives to address ecological challenges. Neobiota provided an excellent
  opportunity to disseminate key results, gain valuable feedback, and expand
  collaborative networks, reinforcing the impact of this research on invasive
  species management.
