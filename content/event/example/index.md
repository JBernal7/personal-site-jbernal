  The populations of birds change over time and their evolution is known thanks to the Sacre program of SEO/BirdLife. The wide distribution of common birds requires the participation of numerous people so that the information is representative of the whole country. Thousands of volunteers have participated in this bird monitoring program since 1996, and it is important to maintain this contribution to cover more territory and also replace volunteers who cannot continue.

The data can be conveniently recorded with a very simple mobile app (available on Android and iOS) that allows you to send the information as soon as the sampling is finished.
