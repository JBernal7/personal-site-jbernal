Habitat suitability and distribution models are increasingly being used to inform conservation efforts, allowing scientists to identify priority areas for conservation and predict the impacts of land use changes on species distributions. These models use a range of data, such as environmental variables and species occurrence records, to estimate the suitability of an area for a particular species. However, traditional models have limitations, such as the assumption that species are in equilibrium with their environment and the use of single-scale data.

New techniques for modeling species distributions are now being developed that address these limitations and provide more accurate predictions of species distributions. One such technique is dynamic range modeling, which takes into account both climate change and species' ability to disperse, allowing for more realistic predictions of range shifts over time.

Another technique is multi-scale modeling, which incorporates data from multiple scales, such as habitat characteristics at the landscape and patch scale. This approach allows for more precise predictions of species distributions and can identify areas that may have been missed by traditional models.

In addition, species distribution models are also being integrated with other models, such as population models, to predict the impacts of conservation actions on species populations. For example, models that integrate species distribution and population dynamics data can be used to estimate the effects of habitat restoration on species populations.

Finally, machine learning algorithms are also being used to develop more accurate and efficient species distribution models. By analyzing large datasets, these algorithms can identify complex relationships between species and their environment, providing more accurate predictions of species distributions.

Overall, new techniques for modeling species distributions are providing more accurate predictions of species distributions, allowing for more effective conservation efforts. These techniques incorporate a range of data and account for a variety of factors, providing a more complete understanding of species-environment interactions and the impacts of conservation actions.
