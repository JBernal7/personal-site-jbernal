For years, scientists have used environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, and topography to model species distributions. While these variables can provide useful information, they do not capture the full complexity of species-environment interactions. As a result, new techniques are being developed that incorporate both biotic and abiotic factors into species distribution modeling.

One such technique is the use of species interaction networks to model co-occurrence patterns. In this approach, species are modeled as interacting nodes within a network, and the likelihood of co-occurrence is determined by both abiotic and biotic factors, such as resource availability and competition. By incorporating species interactions, this approach can provide more accurate predictions of species distributions and help to identify potential areas of conflict or synergy between species.

Another technique that incorporates both biotic and abiotic factors is machine learning. By analyzing large datasets, machine learning algorithms can identify complex relationships between species and their environment, including biotic factors such as the presence of other species. This approach can also identify non-linear relationships and interactions between multiple variables, providing a more accurate and nuanced understanding of species-environment interactions.

Finally, new research is also exploring the use of genetic data to inform species distribution modeling. By analyzing genetic diversity across a species' range, scientists can identify areas of high genetic diversity, which may indicate regions of historical or current refugia. This information can then be used to refine species distribution models and provide more accurate predictions of future range shifts.

Overall, the incorporation of biotic factors into species distribution modeling is an exciting and rapidly developing field. These new techniques have the potential to provide more accurate predictions of species distributions, better inform conservation strategies, and help us to better understand the complex interactions between species and their environment.
